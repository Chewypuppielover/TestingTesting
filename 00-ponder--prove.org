* Instructions
  Hints and rubrics (how to get points) for each gradebook item are available
  --- come to class to learn how to access them.

  Master Hint: To get full credit, you are required to:
  - track your time for each task (TODO);
  - mark each task DONE when done; and
  - include a time-tracking summary report here at the top of this file.

  With your cursor on a TODO line, comma I (, I) runs the =org-clock-in=
  command, and comma O (, O) runs the =org-clock-out= command. Afterwards, C-c
  C-x C-d (=org-clock-display=) will display total subtree times, and C-c C-x
  C-r (=org-clock-report=) will insert a table with a clock report where the
  cursor is. (Put the cursor right above the Instructions item.) Once inserted,
  running =org-clock-report= again will update the table.

  Please read 'I' or 'We' as you, the reader(s) rather than me, the writer of
  the Prepare assertions. These say 'I', but be thinking about 'We' as you look
  around for three other classmates you would be comfortable working in a group
  with.

  If you can truthfully assert that you did any of the following, put an X in
  the box. (With Spacemacs bindings, putting the cursor anywhere on the line and
  typing , , (two commas) will toggle the X for you.)

  - [X] I got a GitHub account, or I already had one.
  - [ ] I found and worked through an introductory GitHub/Git tutorial, or I am
    already git/GitHub-literate.
  - [X] I followed instructions to get to my personal GitHub repository, and
    thus got access to this file.
  - [X] I read the textbook\rsquo{}s introductory material (everything before ABC ---
    which means everything up to and including section ONE subsubsection ONI,
    which ends just when subsection ABC begins).

  #+ATTR_HTML: :alt desert image :title What is this doing here?!
  [[file:../img/desert.jpg]]

  This is the first of many exercises/problems/puzzles to come, always displayed
  in this type of yellow-background box.

  Propose a connection between discrete mathematics and the image above.
  (This is a \ldquo{}free association\rdquo exercise --- there is no right answer.)

  The operation called /dehydration/ takes a word and deletes all letters in it
  from H to O. What is the original (rehydrated) text of this dehydrated
  sequence of words?

  What English word has the smallest vowel-consonant-ratio (VCR)? For example,
  the VCRs of the words (including the TLA) in the previous sentence are 1/3,
  2/5, 1/3, 1/2, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/2, 3/2, and 0/3.

  In the figure below, the innermost circle has radius 1. It is circumscribed by
  an equilateral triangle, which is circumscribed by a circle, which is
  circumscribed by a square, which is circumscribed by yet another circle, and
  so forth.

  What is the radius of the outermost circle?

  Pick a number (a positive integer). Form the product of that number, one more
  than that number, and one more than twice that number. Repeat for several
  different numbers. There is a pattern to these products. What is it?

   Numbers and words. Cycles and patterns.

   Do you think mathematicians discover or invent patterns? While pondering that
   question, consider what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] famously wrote: /A mathematician, like a
   painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent/
   /than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas/. What do you think he
   meant by that?

   Here\rsquo{}s a puzzle superficially just involving a 6-digit number and a 6-letter
   \ldquo{}word\rdquo. What does

   654321

   have to do with

   CLAHCK

   other than they both follow the \ldquo{}length 6\rdquo pattern?
